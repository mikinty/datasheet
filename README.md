# datasheet

There are lots of random things about hardware that are hard to find online. Secret "codes" or "systems" if you will, that companies use to help themselves figure out what's going on.

As a hobbyist for electronics and other hardware, I'd like to document some of my findings to help my own curiosity, and also to help others in case they are curious as well. I might make this into a website sometime, but Github markdown is fine by my book.

## Stuff

Will sort this better in the future

- You know what those 4-digit numbers are on powe cord prongs? [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylCUqsu9s-A) explains it quite well, but e.g. if you have 3621, you know it's 
  - 3rd day of the week (Wednesday, if we start with Monday)
  - Year ending in 6. You have to use some context with this, but you can usually figure out when this was. E.g. if recent, then 2016 is probably a good guess.
  - 21 represents the 21st week of the year
